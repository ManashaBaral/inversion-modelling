  <em>A Python-based tool to perform inversion of gravity data using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO).</em>

<h2>ðŸ“Œ Overview</h2>
<p>
This project implements forward and inverse gravity modeling techniques in 2D using polygonal bodies. The core goal is to recover subsurface structures by inverting gravity anomaly data with the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm. The forward model is based on Talwani's method, and inversion aims to minimize the difference between observed and predicted anomalies.
